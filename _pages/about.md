I work at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com) on AI agents, where I build systems that combine Bayesian dependency models with LLMs to identify probable root causes in large-scale cloud environments. My focus is on agent architectures, signal integration, and deterministic diagnostic tooling.

Outside of my industry work, I have contributed extensively to open-source surgical robotics, with contributions to the [da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki) ecosystem and ROS 2 - 3D Slicer medical imaging integrations. 

I have collaborated with [Anton Deguet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CF8qg-AAAAAJ&hl=en), [Axel Krieger](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/axel-krieger/), and [Simon Leonard](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sleonard/) on improving ROS 2 and 3D Slicer integration, including work on [SlicerROS2](https://github.com/rosmed/slicer_ros2_module), ROS 2 pipelines, and surgical simulation workflows. Earlier, I worked with [Dr. Soumyadipta Acharya](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/soumyadipta-acharya/) on [vectorCam](https://vectorcam.org/), a computer-vision project that went on to be featured on Bill Gates' [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTTaWPl2ZE).

I am broadly interested in robotics infrastructure, image-guided surgery, and the systems needed to bridge real robots, simulation environments, and interactive medical imaging tools. 
<!-- Much of my open-source work has focused on tools like 3D Slicer, ROS 2, and surgical-robot simulation frameworks, along with building calibration, teleoperation, and experimentation pipelines for the dVRK. -->

Academically, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I worked within the medical robotics community, and my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

#### Current Technical Interests

- AI agents for diagnostics and reasoning
- Surgical robotics research infrastructure
- ROS 2 / 3D Slicer / Isaac Sim integration
- Distributed inference systems and transformer internals
- Video-based action learning for vision-language-action models

I enjoy collaborating on problems at the intersection of AI systems, robotics, and simulation, and I'm always happy to connect with researchers or engineers working in these areas.
